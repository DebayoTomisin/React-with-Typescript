So ideally i am meant to be following a course for this repo but then i decieded to follow a different approach to learning react with typescript, following the course content and creating folders that match things i learn outside of the course and maybe also implementing previous javascript react projects with typescript and see what differences there is.
The main project for this course will have a seperate repository that will be created when the time for that comes around.
